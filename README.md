## Overview
This analysis used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, by using the converted datatype, we created a set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
#### Males were the most common users

## Summary 
Overall, males were the most common users and subscribers. In addition, most users rode bikes betweeb 5-7pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. The peak hours to ride a bike seemed to be in the evenings. A suggestion may be to run a promotion price for the hours that bikes are not being rode. This may encourage users to ride bikes during the promotion time. The below graph shows the peak hours that bikes were rode in August. Another suggestion would be to provide a discount price for customers to become subscribers after their first ride. This may increase the number of subscribers.
